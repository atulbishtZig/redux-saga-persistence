# Redux Saga Persistence example

This example shows how a persistence mechanism can be implemented by using Redux Sagas.

Check the code for the persistence saga [here](https://github.com/jportela/redux-saga-persistence/blob/master/src/sagas/persistence.js). I've written a blog post detailing the process on how to implement it [here]().
